@article{mfbm-howrich,
  abstract = {The multifractional Brownian motion (MBM) processes are locally
              self-similar Gaussian processes. They extend the classical
              fractional Brownian motion processes BH={BH(t)}t∈R by allowing
              their self-similarity parameter H∈(0,1) to depend on time. Two
              types of MBM processes were introduced independently by Peltier and
              L{\'e}vy-Vehel [Multifractional Brownian motion: definition and
              preliminary results, Technical Report 2645, Institut National de
              Recherche en Informatique et an Automatique, INRIA, Le Chesnay,
              France, 1995] and Benassi, Jaffard, Roux [Elliptic Gaussian random
              processes, Rev. Mat. Iber. 13(1) (1997) 19--90] by using
              time-domain and frequency-domain integral representations of the
              fractional Brownian motion, respectively. Their correspondence was
              studied by Cohen [From self-similarity to local self-similarity:
              the estimation problem, in: M. Dekking, J.L. V{\'e}hel, E. Lutton,
              C. Tricot (Eds.), Fractals: Theory and Applications in Engineering,
              Springer, Berlin, 1999]. Contrary to what has been stated in the
              literature, we show that these two types of processes have
              different correlation structures when the function H(t) is
              non-constant. We focus on a class of MBM processes parameterized by
              (a+,a-)∈R2, which contains the previously introduced two types of
              processes as special cases. We establish the connection between
              their time- and frequency-domain integral representations and
              obtain explicit expressions for their covariances. We show, that
              there are non-constant functions H(t) for which the correlation
              structure of the MBM processes depends non-trivially on the value
              of (a+,a-) and hence, even for a given function H(t), there are an
              infinite number of MBM processes with essentially different
              distributions.},

@article{estimation-dependent-strong-mixing,
  abstract = {In the present paper, we extend the work of Slaoui (Stat Sin
              30:417--437, 2020) in the case of strong mixing data. Since, we are
              interested in nonparametric regression estimation, we focus on well
              adapted dependence structures based on mixing type conditions. We
              study the properties of these regression estimators and compare
              them with the nonparametric non-recursive regression estimator. The
              bias, variance and mean squared error are computed explicitly. We
              showed that using a selected wild bootstrap bandwidth procedure and
              a special stepsize, our proposed recursive regression estimators
              allowed us to obtain quite similar results compared to the
              non-recursive regression estimator under {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}
              alpha {\$}{\$}-mixing condition in terms of estimation error and
              much better in terms of computational costs.},
