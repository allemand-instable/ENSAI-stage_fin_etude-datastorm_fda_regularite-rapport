@article{mfbm-howrich,
    abstract   = {The multifractional Brownian motion (MBM) processes are locally self-similar Gaussian processes. They extend the classical fractional Brownian motion processes BH={BH(t)}t∈R by allowing their self-similarity parameter H∈(0,1) to depend on time. Two types of MBM processes were introduced independently by Peltier and L{\'e}vy-Vehel [Multifractional Brownian motion: definition and preliminary results, Technical Report 2645, Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et an Automatique, INRIA, Le Chesnay, France, 1995] and Benassi, Jaffard, Roux [Elliptic Gaussian random processes, Rev. Mat. Iber. 13(1) (1997) 19--90] by using time-domain and frequency-domain integral representations of the fractional Brownian motion, respectively. Their correspondence was studied by Cohen [From self-similarity to local self-similarity: the estimation problem, in: M. Dekking, J.L. V{\'e}hel, E. Lutton, C. Tricot (Eds.), Fractals: Theory and Applications in Engineering, Springer, Berlin, 1999]. Contrary to what has been stated in the literature, we show that these two types of processes have different correlation structures when the function H(t) is non-constant. We focus on a class of MBM processes parameterized by (a+,a-)∈R2, which contains the previously introduced two types of processes as special cases. We establish the connection between their time- and frequency-domain integral representations and obtain explicit expressions for their covariances. We show, that there are non-constant functions H(t) for which the correlation structure of the MBM processes depends non-trivially on the value of (a+,a-) and hence, even for a given function H(t), there are an infinite number of MBM processes with essentially different distributions.},

    abstract      = {In the present paper, we extend the work of Slaoui (Stat Sin 30:417--437, 2020) in the case of strong mixing data. Since, we are interested in nonparametric regression estimation, we focus on well adapted dependence structures based on mixing type conditions. We study the properties of these regression estimators and compare them with the nonparametric non-recursive regression estimator. The bias, variance and mean squared error are computed explicitly. We showed that using a selected wild bootstrap bandwidth procedure and a special stepsize, our proposed recursive regression estimators allowed us to obtain quite similar results compared to the non-recursive regression estimator under {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}alpha {\$}{\$}-mixing condition in terms of estimation error and much better in terms of computational costs.},
